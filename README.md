# Cognifyz-DS-L3T3
# Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project aims to create visualizations that help understand the distribution of ratings, compare average ratings across different cuisines or cities, and explore the relationship between various features and the target variable. The visualizations will be used to gain insights into the dataset and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Tasks

1. **Distribution of Ratings**
   - Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts:
     - **Histogram**: To show the frequency of different rating values.
     - **Bar Plot**: To compare the count of ratings across different categories.
   
2. **Comparison of Average Ratings**
   - Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations:
     - **Box Plot**: To compare the spread and central tendency of ratings across different cuisines or cities.
     - **Bar Plot**: To show the average ratings for each cuisine or city.

3. **Feature Relationship Analysis**
   - Visualize the relationship between various features (e.g., cost, location, review count) and the target variable (ratings) to identify any patterns or trends:
     - **Scatter Plot**: To visualize the relationship between numerical features and ratings.
     - **Heatmap**: To identify correlations between numerical features and ratings.
     - **Pair Plot**: To analyze multiple feature relationships in one view.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis library for handling datasets.
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical operations.

4. Analyze the visualizations:
    - Interpret the distribution of ratings and identify patterns.
    - Compare the average ratings of cuisines or cities.
    - Investigate the relationships between features and ratings.

## Conclusion

The project provides insights into the distribution of ratings, comparison of average ratings across cuisines or cities, and the relationship between features and the target variable. The visualizations help in understanding key patterns and trends that could drive decision-making.
